// Space Complexity

// Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the
// amount of time taken by a program to run as a function
// of length of the input. It is directly proportional to
// the largest memory your program aquires at any
// instance during run time. 

//Example:
int n;//4 byte
cin>>n;
int a=0;//4 byte
for (int i = 1; i <=n; i++)//4 byte
{
    a=a+1;
}
// Hence this program will always aqire a total
// of 12 bytes in total of the memory

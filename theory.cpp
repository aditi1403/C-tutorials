// Space Complexity

// Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the
// amount of time taken by a program to run as a function
// of length of the input. It is directly proportional to
// the largest memory your program aquires at any
// instance during run time. 

//Example:
int n;//4 byte
cin>>n;
int a=0;//4 byte
for (int i = 1; i <=n; i++)//4 byte
{
    a=a+1;
}
// Hence this program will always aqire a total
// of 12 bytes in total of the memory

//Case Complexity

// # Worst Case[O(big Oh) notation]
// # Best Case[_(big omega) notation]
// # Average Case[_(big theta) notation]

// Time Complexity Calculation
// .....To be continued

//Comparision of Functions
// * n...this is a variable and we can assign numric values to it as in maths.
// * logn...this is similar to the logarithmic function in maths.
// * sqrt(n)...this is similar to the square root function in maths.
// * logn...this is similar to logarithmic function in maths.
